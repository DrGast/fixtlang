    "The simplest way before loading the game I can think of is to have both in folders called "SPANISH_MALE" and "SPANISH_FEMALE"
 and changing either the variable in fallout.cfg (but I do not know if it only recognize some hardcoded languages or it looks for
 the folder DATA/TEXT/$language) to point to the desired one as language, or moving the "SPANISH_$GENRE" to "SPANISH" (I say moving 
because it is faster). The latter, although I'm sure it would work, would require a few checks to know that you are not erasing any.
 I think the easiest way would be to first check SPANISH alone, then if both genres ones are there, save the original as SPANISH_BAK 
and then rename the appropriate one to SPANISH. If SPANISH exists and one of the genres is missing, it assumes the genre missing is
 the one loaded, and acts in consequence. If SPANISH doesn't exist, it just looks for the desired genre and moves (rename) it."
