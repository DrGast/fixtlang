Message from Sduibek:
GitHub will not let me commit or upload any files with a tilde (~) in the file name.

This is not a big deal since those files are empty (zero size) but it's important to note if you see these files missing, to not worry about it:

ANIMFR~1.MSG
BARTER~1.MSG
CHILDR~1.MSG
GLOW4W~1.MSG
MARCEL~1.MSG
MICHAE~1.MSG
