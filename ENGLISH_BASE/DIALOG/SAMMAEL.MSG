{100}{}{You see Sammael, one of the Scavs from Adytum.}
{101}{}{You see a grungy man in dark blue clothes.}
{102}{}{Hey, I don't believe we've met. You are?}
{103}{}{I'm }
{104}{}{.}
{105}{}{Who's asking?}
{106}{}{Eruh?}
{107}{}{The pleasure's mine. I'm called Sammael.}
{108}{}{What do you do here?}
{109}{}{Nice talking to you.}
{110}{}{Nobody special. Never mind.}
{111}{}{I'm a Scav -- a scavenger. My job is to search out all of
 the Boneyard for useful items and information. Dangerous work.}
{112}{}{Why is it dangerous?}
{113}{}{How do you avoid the Deathclaws?}
{114}{}{Have you scouted out any of the other areas?}
{115}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{116}{}{See you around. If you see me. Heh.}
{117}{}{Well, you got the DeathClaws out there, and then you got the Regulators
 back here in Adytum.  Both ain't the most forgiving types.}
{118}{}{How do you avoid the Deathclaws?}
{119}{}{Have you scouted out any of the other areas?}
{120}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{121}{}{We only work at night, and we're good at what
 we do.  But I'll admit not everyone always comes back.  I sent a guy out
 last week to look for some parts for Miles, and we haven't heard from him since.
 The last transmission I got from him was that he'd found the parts,
 and was on his way back.}
{122}{}{I've done a little scouting. Who do you want to know about?}
{123}{}{The Blades.}
{124}{}{The Deathclaws.}
{125}{}{The Gun Runners.}
{126}{}{The Followers of the Apocalypse.}
{127}{}{The Children of the Cathedral.}
{128}{}{Nobody, thanks.}
{129}{}{The Blades are a pretty sorry sight for a group of people.
 They get by though, and some of them end up here in Adytum if they agree
 to what the Regulators offer them to do.}
{130}{}{Well if you haven't seen them before. They're mean as all hell,
 and like nothing more than to rip a poor Scav's heart out.}
{131}{}{I've heard there's a nest of them somewhere to the east of the Blades,
 but I haven't seen it myself.}
{132}{}{The Gun Runners moved into a big factory up to north-east not
 long ago. Can't tell you much because they have a moat
 filled with radioactive sludge, and you gotta get through the Deathclaws
 to get there.}
{133}{}{The Followers preach peace and tolerance. Nice idea, but
 impractical. They live in a big library to the north-west of us.}
{134}{}{The Children of the Cathedral are based out of a big church
 a ways to the south of here. There are some strange things
 going on there. I've seen creatures that can't be human
 coming in and out of there.}
{135}{}{And if the stories are right, the church is built over
 an old Vault, which Adytum's predecessors lived in.}
{136}{}{Heya. We see each other once more. What's up?}
{137}{}{What was your job, again?}
{138}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{139}{}{Oh, I see. Right. Bye!}
