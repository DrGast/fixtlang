{100}{}{You see the Brotherhood's Doctor.}
{102}{}{Hello, how can I help you?}
{103}{}{I'm injured.}
{104}{}{I'm radiated.}
{105}{}{Do you do operations?}
{106}{}{Tell me about the operations again.}
{107}{}{Ug!}
{108}{}{Are you injured? Let's see...}
{109}{}{That was the problem. There you go. Be more careful out there.}
{110}{}{Sorry, I can't help you if you won't tell me what's wrong.}
{111}{}{ You seem fine.}
{112}{}{There you are. I hope you feel better.}
{113}{}{There you go, but stop getting into fights.}
{114}{}{That should've fixed you up.}
{115}{}{Good as new.}
{116}{}{All healed up.}
{117}{}{Radiation is very dangerous; you should be more careful.}
{118}{}{I don't have the time for games.}
{119}{}{But of course, but it's very costly and time consuming.}
{120}{}{Details?}
{121}{}{Okay, never mind.}
{122}{}{Well, I can help make you stronger, more perceptive, increase
 your endurance, help improve your learning process, and
 increase your dexterity. Which would you like more
 information on? I can only do each operation once.}
{126}{}{Okay, which operation did you want to talk about?}
{127}{}{Strength.}
{128}{}{Perception.}
{129}{}{Endurance.}
{130}{}{Intelligence.}
{131}{}{Agility.}
{132}{}{Never mind.}
{133}{}{That's easy to do but there's a long recovery time. It only
 costs 2000 scripts but takes 3 weeks to heal.}
{135}{}{I'll do it!}
{136}{}{I'll pass.}
{137}{}{Now that's a difficult operation. It costs 4000 scripts, but
 the recovery from this operation is only a week.}
{139}{}{This one's not that difficult. It takes about a week and
 will cost 3000 scripts.}
{141}{}{This is the most complex and dangerous! It'll take 3 weeks
 and costs 6000 scripts.}
{143}{}{This isn't that tough of an operation but it is very costly
 and time consuming. It will take 3 weeks and cost 5000
 scripts.}
{146}{}{Okay, there you go. I hope the foam didn't irritate your skin.}
{147}{}{I'm sorry I can't help you if you don't have the money.}
{148}{}{I'm sorry, but you are an outsider. After you're in the
 Brotherhood for ten years or so I'll be able to do the
 operation for free, but we have expenses and you're not a
 regular working member of the Brotherhood, yet.}
{149}{}{Let me know when you have the funds.}
{153}{}{Did you want to ask about another one?}
{154}{}{Okay, here goes nothing... Just kidding. We can start right
 away. (She gases you and you slowly slip away.)}
{156}{}{So how are we feeling? (You can already tell the difference.)
 You're quite a talkative person in your sleep. You're free
 to go! Good day.}
{159}{}{Out with the old and in with the new... (You drop like a rock
 into an abyss.)}
{161}{}{You look exactly the same, but how do you feel? (All of your
 senses feel much sharper.) Well, you're taking up valuable
 bed space. Get going!}
{164}{}{I hope you have a heart... (She winks at you as you fall
 under.)}
{166}{}{Well, you look a little bulkier. (You feel great!) Well, let
 me know if there are any problems.}
{168}{}{Now where's the brain again? What's this thing supposed to do?
 (You try to fight the drugs but it's a losing battle.)}
{170}{}{Well, it looks like I got it all back in and everything's
 running great. (It's as if the pathways of your thoughts
 have direct links to everywhere in your head and your
 memories are much crisper.) Take it easy.}
{174}{}{All right, let's give it a spin. (The drugs, are so...
 friendly. Your slumber comes quickly.)}
{176}{}{Okay you're ready for duty. (You flex your muscles and can
 feel the increased speed and control.) All I ask of you is
 to please not damage my masterpiece.}
{200}{}{You see the Doctor's assistant.}
{279}{}{You should see the Doctor.}
{280}{}{She's the Doctor, not me.}
{281}{}{I'm only in training.}
{282}{}{I can't help you, officially.}
{283}{}{Lori's the Doctor.}
{284}{}{You have to ask the Doctor.}
{285}{}{Don't worry, she's just a kidder.}
{286}{}{She just likes to tease, don't worry.}
{300}{}{I'm sorry but this operation will not help you.}

{400}{}{Hmmm. If anyone here needs an Intelligence Enhancement, it
 would be you. In fact, I'll do it for 3000 caps instead of the 6000
 you would normally need for the operation. I can't guarantee that it
 will help you, but I think it would be worth a try. It will also
 take 3 weeks of recovery time. You probably don't understand this
 though, do you?}
{401}{}{Me want smart.}
{402}{}{No want.}
{403}{}{Are you radiated or hurt? I'll help you if I can.}
{404}{}{mE hUrt.}
{405}{}{hAir faLl ouT.}
{406}{}{No.}
{407}{}{Ok. You're awake. Let's see here. Do you feel any smarter?}
{408}{}{Hunh?}
{409}{}{Yes!}
{410}{}{Damn! It was a failure. Well I didn't have much to work with.
 Sorry, you're just an idiot and will most likely remain an idiot. We
 can only do the operation once, sorry to say.}
{411}{}{It was a success! I was able to increase your IQ to an acceptable
 level. How does it feel to have half a brain?}
{412}{}{It's great. Thanks, Doc. Bye.}
{413}{}{There you go. All better}
