{100}{}{You see the caravan leader.}
{101}{}{Well, here we are. Here's your payment of }
{102}{}{ caps. [He pulls out an old dog-eared money bag and gives you the money.] You'll get another }
{103}{}{ caps if you return with us to the Hub. We'll rest here for a while, but don't go too far or the caravan will leave without you.}
{104}{}{Aaa... OK.}
{105}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{106}{}{What can you tell me about Junktown?}
{107}{}{What can you tell me about the Boneyard?}
{108}{}{What can you tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{109}{}{I don't know if you'll understand this, but we leave in two hours or whenever you're ready.}
{110}{}{Um...}
{111}{}{Hunh?}
{112}{}{go. Gud.}
{113}{}{Man, we're hiring dumb ones these days.}
{114}{}{We usually leave two hours after arrival.  There's nothing here we haven't seen before, though,
 so if you want to leave earlier we're ready whenever you are.}
{115}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go.  See you later.}
{116}{}{OK.  Let's head back to the Hub.  Nothing I want to see here either.}
{117}{}{What can you tell me about Junktown?}
{118}{}{What can you tell me about the Boneyard?}
{119}{}{What can you tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{120}{}{Well, it's quite a bit like the Hub, really.  It has its share of problems: gangs,
 thugs, thieves, you know... the usual stuff.  All in all, it's my kind of town. [Laughs]}
{121}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{122}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go.  See you later.}
{123}{}{This part of the Boneyard is called Adytum.  The Boneyard is basically run by gangs. Kind of a rough area, so watch your step here. Adytum is run by the Regulators.  They're trying to hold this place together in light of all the gang wars. They're understandably suspicious of strangers, so if you haven't spoken to them yet I suggest you do before you start wandering around.}
{124}{}{Empty}
{125}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{126}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go.  See you later.}
{127}{}{Not much I can tell you about them.  The Brotherhood keeps to themselves for the most part. A lot of people give them a bad rap, but from what I can tell they're good people.  A little fanatical, maybe, but good guys.}
{128}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{129}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go.  See you later.}
{130}{}{Are you ready to go?}
{131}{}{go!}
{132}{}{No.  I'm still looking around.}
{133}{}{Yeah.  We can go.}
{134}{}{This part of the Boneyard is call Adytum.  The Boneyard is basically run by gangs. Kind of a rough area, so watch your step here.}
{135}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{136}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go.  See you later.}
{137}{}{OK.  You made it. Here's your }
{138}{}{ caps.  If you want more work, just go talk to the boss again.  I'd be more than happy to work with you again. I'll put in a good word for you with the boss. Take it easy.}
{139}{}{bY bY.}
{140}{}{See ya.}
{141}{}{Hey, how's it goin'?}
{142}{}{If you want more work, go check with the boss.}
{143}{}{You got somethin's wrong with you?}
{144}{}{You're a freakin' psycho!}
{145}{}{I'm not working with you!}
{146}{}{200}
{147}{}{400}
{148}{}{600}
{149}{}{What can you tell me about the Necropolis?}
{150}{}{Nasty freakin' place, man!}
{151}{}{The caravan has left.}


{200}{}{Hmmmpf...}
{201}{}{Hmm... I wish I could read.}


{300}{}{Mind your own business, would you?}

{400}{}{I'm not paid to talk.}
