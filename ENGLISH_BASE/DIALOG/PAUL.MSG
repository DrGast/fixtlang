{100}{}{You see Knight Paul.}
{101}{}{Ahhh, so you're the new initiate.  Welcome aboard.  What can I do for you?}
{102}{}{Who are you and what do you do here?}
{103}{}{Where can I get some weapons?}
{104}{}{Vree told me I could see a new weapon.}
{105}{}{Do you have a water chip?}
{106}{}{Do you have any Power Armor parts?}
{107}{}{Whaadda?}
{108}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{109}{}{I'm Paul, head of Energy Weapons Development.}
{110}{}{What kind of Energy Weapons?}
{111}{}{Do you have the Laser Pistol that Vree designed?}
{112}{}{Laser, Plasma... you name it, I've built it.. or at least re-built it.}
{113}{}{Any chance I can get one?}
{114}{}{That's great.  Keep up the good work. Bye.}
{115}{}{You would have to see Michael to be issued a weapon. He can't authorize you for one though, for that
 you would have to see Talus.}
{116}{}{Alright, where can I find them?}
{117}{}{Ok. Thanks for the info, bye.}
{118}{}{They are both on the first floor of the base.  Talus is usually in the training
 room and Michael does his duty just outside of the storage room.}
{119}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{120}{}{Thanks.  I'll be going now.}
{121}{}{Sure.  What can I help you with?}
{122}{}{Where can I get some new weapons?}
{123}{}{Do you have a water chip?}
{124}{}{Do you have any parts for Power Armor?}
{125}{}{Can I see the new laser pistol?}
{126}{}{Actually, I need to get going. Bye.}
{127}{}{Yes. The latest in hand held laser technology. [He
 takes a small pistol from a work table and hands it to you]}
{128}{}{This is nice, can I keep this? }
{129}{}{What kind of damage will this do to a person?}
{130}{}{That one won't do you much good.  It's still lacking the lenses and amplifier.
 [He takes the pistol back from you and puts it on the work table]
 If you really want one, go talk to Talus or Michael.}
{131}{}{Thanks, where can I find them?}
{132}{}{Thanks, I should be going now.}
{133}{}{Can I ask you some more questions?}
{134}{}{A Water Chip?  The ones from the old Vault-Tec shelters?}
{135}{}{Yes!.. Do you have one?}
{136}{}{No. Those things were junk, they were prone to failure.  We don't deal with
 purifying our own water here.  We have water delivered by caravans from the Hub.}
{137}{}{Ok.  Thanks.  Well I've got to keep looking for one. Bye.}
{138}{}{Could I ask you some more questions?}
{139}{}{In the hands of a skilled warrior, it could cut a person in half.
 The beam will shear flesh faster then you can run your finger through sand.}
{140}{}{Can I keep this one?}
{141}{}{No.  I only work on Energy weapons.  You should go see Kyle if you have questions about Power Armor.}
{142}{}{Actually Kyle doesn't have the parts, that why I'm looking for them.}
{143}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{144}{}{Well, I can't help you with that.  Sorry.}
{145}{}{Thanks.  I need to get going. Bye.}
{146}{}{Can I ask you some more questions?}
{147}{}{Hello again, Initiate }
{148}{}{.  What can I help you with?}
{149}{}{Who are you and what do you do here?}
{150}{}{Where can I get some weapons?}
{151}{}{Vree told me I could see a new weapon.}
{152}{}{Do you have a water chip?}
{153}{}{Do you have any Power Armor parts?}
{154}{}{Whaadda?}
{155}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{156}{}{Um.. please leave before you drool on something important.}
