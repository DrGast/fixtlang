# Fallout-Fixt-localization
This repository will hold all the translations for my Fallout mod, Fallout Fixt. This will allow tracking on incremental changes and better collaboration for translation teams.

Please note that the non-English files are not and were not created by me. I am simply providing the existing translated files as a resource basis for each translation.


-------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRANSLATORS & TRANSLATIONS:
-------------------------------------------------

0)  GitHub will not let me commit or upload any files with a tilde (~) in the file name.

This is not a big deal since those files are empty (zero size) but it's important to note if you see these files missing, to not worry about it:

	ANIMFR~1.MSG
	BARTER~1.MSG
	CHILDR~1.MSG
	GLOW4W~1.MSG
	MARCEL~1.MSG
	MICHAE~1.MSG


1)  Check this repository periodically as I may add more tools over time. The link contains information and files on:

- Quotation marks and elipsis being changed to their "dumb" counterparts.
- Two tools for converting graphics (such as interface) into editable file types. If you're working on translating Splash screens, you can convert to/from RIX (splash screen) file format using viewer.exe, Titanium browser can export FRM (Fallout graphics) to BMP/GIF/etc.
- Registry entries to associate Fallout dialog files with text-editors.  Most files are in *.MSG format, and cutscene subtitles are in *.SVE format.
- (NOT YET ADDED) templates for splash screens by Luffier, and text formatting scripts by Luffier
- Archive of all Fixt text and dialog back to alpha 6.0

2)  Unless we discussed otherwise, you should have been provided access to this project as a Collaborator, but it's open to anyone to make changes.
    Typically this repo will contain:
    
- ENGLISH default text files from v1.2 Fallout1 ("English Original")
- Files in your language ("{language} Original")  -  I have provided all I could find, it's possible that more exist. These may be in multiple folders if there was different translations, or multiple translations for patches/mods.
- Graphics files, if available, such as Splash screens and Interface files.
- Downloaded archives and/or executables of translations in your language, if available.


3) The newest text and dialog files for Fallout Fixt, as well as this readme file, can always be found at:

	https://github.com/Sduibek/Fallout-Fixt-localization


4) If you don't use them already, the programs Windows Grep, Beyond Compare, Notepad++ and FolderMatch are very useful. I've also heard good things about Ultra Edit although I don't personally use it.
	BEYOND COMPARE:  http://www.scootersoftware.com/download.php
	WINDOWS GREP:  http://www.wingrep.com/download.htm
	FOLDERMATCH:  http://www.foldermatch.com/fmdownload.htm
	NOTEPAD++:  http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/download
	ULTRA EDIT:  http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads.html

   If you know of a better program or other useful ones, please let me know.


5) Some files have been renamed, others merged, and others are brand new with Fixt. If you compare folders, that's why you will see these differences.
   Please use these filenames, so that filenames match with Fixt. If you don't, users will get errors and probably crashes too!


 The full list of new dialig files compared to a Vanilla installation is at the bottom of this text file.


"ASSBLOW" is now named "KALNOR"

6) For the files TRAIT.MSG, PERK.MSG, PRO_MISC.MSG, EDITOR.MSG, you must use the versions from the *subfolders* within GAME folder! The naming of the files should be clear, but please ask me if you have questions. Usually they are not much different; you can compare which parts differ with BeyondCompare.

 - Please translate both copies of the files. Either of them can be chosen by user during install so they both need to be translated. There should be 3 subdirectories; one each for Trait Names, Addiction Titles, and Exit Grid Descriptions.


7) Files from DIALOG folder you can safely leave un-translated. This includes files from the demo:

 - BAKA
 - BARSTOW
 - CHEATER
 - DEMOLEX
 - DUMAR
 - FKE_DUDE
 - JUNKDEMO
 - LENNY
 - LEX
 - PEZ
 - PHRAX
 - RAYZE
 - ROCK
 - SKIPPY
 - SKIZZER
 - TEST


8) Let me know what name or username you want to be called in the credits :)
