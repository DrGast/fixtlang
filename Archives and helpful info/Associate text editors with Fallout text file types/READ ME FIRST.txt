These will associate some Fallout file types with several common text-editor programs,
 making it easy to open them so that you don't have to set up the associations yourself.

If you are using Windows (or a Windows virtual machine such as Wine) you can simply
 right-click -> "Merge" on these files,
 or go to Start -> Run -> "regedit.exe" -> File -> Import and browse to the file(s).


Let me know if you experience any issues with these files!
