The following changes have been made in the Fallout Fixt text and dialog files,
 and the files for my copy of your language's translation as well:


1)  "Smart" quotation marks and apostrophes changed to their "dumb" equivalents.
 For the codes required to text-search for smart quotes, see the first link below.
 For the dumb quote codes you will be replacing them with, see the second link below.

	Dumb quotes:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Typing_quotation_marks_on_a_computer_keyboard


2)  Elipsis (three dots, a pause in dialog) have been replaced with three consecutive periods (...)
 and in all cases the space before it has been removed. So for example, " …" has become "..."

3)  You can copy-paste all of these symbols into Notepad++ and do a Replace All In All Opened Files.
 I have done this opening roughly 300-to-400 files at a time in Notepad++ without issues.
