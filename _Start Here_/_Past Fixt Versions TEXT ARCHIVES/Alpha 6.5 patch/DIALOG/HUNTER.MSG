# Chris Avellone is a male bounty hunter. He has an abrupt attitude and is serious about
# his money. He does not like child killers (which is the only way the player will meet him).

{100}{}{You see a burly bounty hunter with a button that reads, 'I'm Christopher and you're meat.'}
# Bounty Hunter is considered Male term

{101}{}{What do you want?}
{102}{}{A doughnut.}
{103}{}{What are you doing here?}
{104}{}{Just looking around.}
{105}{}{Nothing.}
{106}{}{We don't appreciate wise guys here. Buzz off.}
# Alternate for "Buzz off" could be "Get lost" or "Get out of here"

{107}{}{That joke wasn't even funny the first time. You're about to discover why I'm one of the most fearsome bounty hunters in the wasteland. And I won't even get paid for it.}
{108}{}{None of your business.}
{109}{}{Well, go poke around somewhere else.}
# Alternate for "poke around" could be "Look around"

{110}{}{Did you know that there's a bounty of }
{200}{}{ caps on your head for killing children? Time to collect!}
# Children is considered male plural

{111}{}{[Christopher makes a close look over you, considering something... it seems, he's made a decision already] Tell me, how often do you visit Hub or Junktown?}
{112}{}{Often enough, why do you ask?}
{113}{}{Well, you see... Business takes almost all of my time and I don't have an opportunity to get there. And as an incurable smoker I miss an old Zippo lighter very much. It's said, many of those pre-War items could be found in the shops there. If you get a Zippo for me, I'll share with you some information about the neighboring settlements. I think it could be of use!}
{114}{}{It's a pity. Looks like I made a mistake on you. Get out of here.}
{115}{}{Why not, I'll get one for you.}
{116}{}{Okay.}
{117}{}{Hey, I have one right here. I don't really need it and can give you in exchange for the information.}
{118}{}{Thank you! [takes the lighter] So, what do you want to hear, exactly?}
{119}{}{Here is your lighter. Time to give me some information.}
{120}{}{No more questions, thanks.}
{121}{}{[More]}
{122}{}{What else do you want to know?}
{123}{}{I need some information.}
{124}{}{Buuhhh.. Wuh?}
{125}{}{Are you serious? Get out of my sight.}
{126}{}{I'm going to do the world a favor by putting a bullet through your skull.}
