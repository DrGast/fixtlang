{100}{}{You see the Elder of Shady Sands.}
{101}{}{I am pleased to meet you. I hope you have found our little village pleasing so far.}
{102}{}{Yes.}
{103}{}{Nope, just not enough action around here.}
{104}{}{Excellent. I have a favor to ask of you. I assure you that you will be well-rewarded for your services to this community.}
{105}{}{I'm listening... }
{106}{}{This is just a demo, but perhaps you will like what I have to say next.}
{107}{}{I'm all ears... }
{108}{}{We have been plagued by radscorpions for some time now. All who have been sent to destroy these monsters have not returned. I will give you weapons and armor if you will follow a guide to their lair and kill them.}
{109}{}{Sounds good.}
{110}{}{No thanks. Not my style.}
{111}{}{That is a shame. Please leave.}
{112}{}{Excellent. Seth can guide you to the lair. Take these items - they will come in handy.}
{113}{}{Please help us as soon as possible. Time is of the essence.}
{114}{}{I don't talk to your kind, stranger.}
{115}{}{Thank you! You've saved our village from peril. It is safe now to travel across the surrounding areas. Accept this as a token of our gratitude. (He gives you some caps.)}
{116}{}{Thank you. We owe you so much.}
